Zazen light colors for Sublime Text 2 or 3
==========================================

"Less is exponentially more" - Rob Pike.

I could not agree more with the above statement.

Tired of looking at rainbow color highlighting for source code so popular these days. Black background with neon foreground colors...
It looks sharp and crisp but I doubt it is really ergonomic for long programming hours.

This color scheme is not mono-chromatic but every attempt was made to make it look less like mozaic of sharp colors.
It uses only few mild colors for syntax highlighting. Readability is key.

* Background is slightly off-white. Foreground is dark gray.
* Tested on Google Go and HTML.
* Comments are in italic to make them stand out.
* Tested on Sublime Text 3

Zazen name here implies simplicity.

Examples

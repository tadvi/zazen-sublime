Zazen light colors for Sublime Text 2 or 3
==========================================

Tired of looking at rainbow color highlighting for source code so popular these days? Black background with neon foreground colors...
It looks sharp and crisp but I doubt it is really ergonomic for long programming hours.

This color scheme is not mono-chromatic but every attempt was made to make it look less like mozaic of sharp colors.
It uses only few mild colors for syntax highlighting. Readability is key.

* Background is white. Foreground is dark gray.
* Tested on Google Go and HTML with Sublime Text 3.
* Comments are not italic but light colored. Emphasis here because comments are not executable code.

Zazen name here implies simplicity. Focus on code itself instead of how pretty the code syntax looks like.
